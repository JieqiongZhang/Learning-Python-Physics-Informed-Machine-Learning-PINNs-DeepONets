# Learning-PINNs-in-Python

Hi, Iâ€™m Juan Diego Toscano. Thanks for stopping by.

This repository will help you get involved in the physics-informed machine learning world. In particular, it is a step-by-step guide that covers some of the basic concepts required to run a Physics-informed Neural Network(PINN) in Pytorch (from approximating functions, solving PDEs, forward and Inverse problems). You will also find some tutorials on Deeponets. 

I solved some of the problems on this repository on my Youtube channel, so please review them if you have time.

Right now, I am a bit busy. However, in the future, I will upload more examples on DeepOnets, and other types of PINNs.

If you have any questions or if I can help you in some way, please feel free to reach me at: juan_toscano@brown.edu.

Most of the examples in this repository were taken from:
