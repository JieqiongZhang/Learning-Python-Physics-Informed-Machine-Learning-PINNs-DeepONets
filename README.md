# Learning-PINNs-in-Pytorch

Hi, I’m Juan Diego Toscano!
I am from Ecuador, and I will be starting my Engineering, Ph.D. - Fluids and Thermal Sciences program at Brown University next fall. I’m interested in Scientific Machine Learning, so I’m currently studyin PINNs and DeepOnets.

This reposository is mainly to get involved in the huge world of physics informed machine learning. It is an step-by-step guide that covers the base knowledge to run a PINN in Pytorch. From approximating functions to solving PDEs.

I will keep uploading new examples in the future.

If you have any questions or if I can help you in some way, please feel free to reach me at: juan_toscano@brown.edu.
