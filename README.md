# Learning-PINNs-in-Pytorch

Hi, Iâ€™m Juan Diego Toscano. Thanks for stopping by.

This repository will help you get involved in the huge world of physics-informed machine learning. In particular, it is a step-by-step guide that covers the base knowledge to run a PINN in Pytorch (from approximating functions to solving PDEs).

Right now, I am a bit busy. However, I will upload some youtube videos and more complicated examples in the future.

If you have any questions or if I can help you in some way, please feel free to reach me at: juan_toscano@brown.edu.

Note: Most of the examples in this repository were taken from the DeepXDE library (https://deepxde.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
