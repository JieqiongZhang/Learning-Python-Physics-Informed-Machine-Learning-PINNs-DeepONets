# Learning-PINNs-in-Pytorch

Hi, Iâ€™m Juan Diego Toscano. Thanks for stopping by.

This repository will help you get involved in the physics-informed machine learning world. In particular, it is a step-by-step guide that covers some basic concepts needed to run a PINN in Pytorch (from approximating functions to solving PDEs).

Right now, I am a bit busy. However, in the future, I will upload more examples on inverse problems, DeepOnets, and other types of PINNs.

If you have any questions or if I can help you in some way, please feel free to reach me at: juan_toscano@brown.edu.

**Note:** 
Most of the examples in this repository were taken from the DeepXDE library (https://deepxde.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
